For this assignment, you're going to start an RNA-seq analysis project from scratch.

1. Set up a personal GitHub repository for the project
2. Make a new directory on the server to house the analysis.
3. Pick 2 tissues from `FILE PATH` on the server and copy them to your project folder
4. Use the code we went over in lectures to process the tissue RNA-seq files in the folder you create on the server
 - Check quality
 - Trim
 - Align
 - Count
5. All the of code you used should be documented in a markdown file that should be backed up to your GitHub repository
6. To submit the assignment, email me a link to your GitHub repository. I'll be looking at the markdown file in the GitHub repository and also your results on the server.
