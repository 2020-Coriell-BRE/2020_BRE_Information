#### Operating System Specific Programs

##### Mac

1. You will need to use the terminal application to connect to remote servers. This comes with the Mac, so no additional software is needed, but it's not listed in the Applications folder. Use Spotlight to search for Terminal, then pin it to the Dock so you're prepared to use it when we get to it.
2. Download and install XQuartz <https://www.xquartz.org/>. This will let you view images from the server.
3. Download and install Cyberduck. <https://cyberduck.io/>
4. Install Git <https://git-scm.com/download/mac>

##### PC

1. Download and install PuTTy <https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/.> This will let you connect to the server.
2. Download and install XMing <https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/>. This will let you view images from the server.
3. Download and install WinSCP <https://winscp.net/eng/index.php>. This will let you transfer files to and from your computer and the server.
